# Breast-Cancer-Classifier
This is a project about implementing K-Nearest Neighbor classifier from Codecademy. The dataset I worked with was breast cancer patients and the objective is to predict if a patient will classify either as "malignant" or "benign". After setting up the algorithm, I adjust the 'k' value to see what the best k value is that will give us the highest accuracy.
